## Opening Experience

I'm not interested in teaching you to sound like everyone else, and I'm guessing you're not interested in learning that either. Over 12 weeks, we'll explore music as the mysterious, divine energy it truly is – something you collaborate with rather than simply create.

Have you noticed that nearly every production tutorial teaches you what buttons to press, but almost none address why you're pressing them in the first place? What if creating distinctive music isn't about finding the right techniques, but about rediscovering the emotional truth that drew you to music initially?

This is an invitation to transformation, not information. I can't promise this course will be easy – questioning fundamental assumptions rarely is. But I can promise that if you're willing to approach music as a conversation rather than a conquest, you'll discover a creative freedom that technical knowledge alone can never provide.

## About TÂCHES

I didn't arrive at my production philosophy through theoretical exploration. It emerged from years of frustration, questioning, and eventually breaking free from conventional production wisdom that simply wasn't serving my creative spirit.


Early in my career, I followed the standard path – technical obsession, reference track imitation, genre conventions. I released music that garnered industry approval but left me feeling strangely empty. Despite external validation, the music didn't feel authentic to me.


The transformation began when I started asking more fundamental questions: Why am I making music at all? What am I trying to express? These simple questions shifted my entire approach from technically-driven to emotionally-driven. Instead of making music to impress other producers, I began creating emotional experiences I wanted to share. This wasn't a rejection of technique, but a reorientation of its purpose – from an end in itself to a means of authentic expression.

This approach isn't abstract theory – it's the concrete foundation of my career. Over 118 releases, collaborations with artists like ZHU and RÜFÜS DU SOL, and more than 71 million streams have come from maintaining an unwavering commitment to authentic expression.

I've made decisions that industry insiders considered career suicide: releasing music that didn't fit neatly into marketable genres, turning down commercial opportunities that didn't align with my vision, prioritizing emotional resonance over algorithmic optimization. These choices were strategic investments in developing a distinctive voice in an industry drowning in sameness.

The results speak for themselves – not just in streaming numbers, but in building a sustainable career on my own terms. When you make music that authentically expresses your unique perspective, you stop competing with everyone else and start connecting with listeners who resonate with your specific voice.

I never intended to become a teacher. My focus was creating my own music, not explaining my process. But as my career developed, producers kept asking the same question: "How do you create music that sounds so distinctively yours?"

When I began sharing my approach, the response surprised me. Producers weren't just interested in technical tips – they were hungry for a different way of thinking about music creation entirely. They had plenty of technical knowledge but were struggling with the fundamental questions of artistic voice and emotional expression.

This course isn't about transferring my specific techniques to you. It's about sharing a methodology for discovering your own approach to production – one that's aligned with your unique perspective and emotional landscape. I'm not interested in students who want to sound like me – I'm interested in helping producers develop the courage and clarity to sound like themselves.

## The Current Reality

There's something profoundly wrong with how we teach music production today. We've reduced a deeply emotional, almost spiritual art form to a series of technical procedures. "Use this EQ setting." "Follow this arrangement template." "Process your drums this way." What's missing from this approach is the entire reason we make music in the first place – to express something meaningful.

I've met countless producers who can recite the perfect attack time for a compressor but freeze when asked what emotion they're trying to convey in their music. They've developed technical skills but neglected to develop their artistic voice. They know how to make things sound "professional" but not how to make things sound like themselves.

This imbalance creates a peculiar kind of suffering – the frustration of having all the technical knowledge in the world but still feeling that something essential is missing from your music. That missing element isn't another plugin or technique – it's purpose, intention, and emotional truth.

And yet, rather than addressing this deeper need, most producers fall deeper into what I call "endless student syndrome" – the endless cycle of consuming production knowledge without implementing it. I see producers who've watched hundreds of hours of tutorials, purchased dozens of courses, and amassed plugin collections worth thousands of dollars – yet they have barely any finished music to show for it.

This pattern isn't accidental. The music production education industry profits from perpetuating the myth that you just need one more tutorial, one more plugin, one more course before you'll be "ready" to make the music you envision. But this readiness never arrives because the consumption itself becomes the activity, replacing actual music creation.

The harsh truth is that no amount of passive learning will transform you into the producer you want to be. Only finishing music – messy, imperfect, real music – can do that. The industry doesn't emphasize this because there's no profit in telling you that you already have everything you need to start making meaningful work.

The consequences of this consumption-over-creation mindset extend far beyond individual frustration. The most alarming crisis in electronic music today isn't technical – producers have never been more technically skilled. It's a crisis of authenticity. Despite unprecedented access to production knowledge, much of today's music lacks a distinctive voice or emotional core.

This homogenization happens because conventional production education emphasizes emulation over exploration. New producers are taught to reverse-engineer successful tracks, to follow established patterns, to create within narrow genre constraints. While these approaches can build technical skills, they often come at the cost of developing a genuine artistic voice.

When you're constantly looking outward for validation and direction, you neglect the most valuable source of musical inspiration: your own lived experience, perspective, and emotional landscape. The result is music that might sound professional but fails to resonate deeply because it doesn't authentically express anything personal or unique.

## A Different Perspective

I've spent years unlearning the idea that I'm a creator of music. Instead, I've come to understand myself as a collaborator with music – a force that exists independently of my efforts to capture it. Think of music as a wild, enigmatic energy that's been resonating through the universe since long before DAWs, plugins, or even instruments existed.

My role isn't to invent this energy but to build a relationship with it. To listen carefully to what it wants to become, to steward it through technical decisions that honor its inherent nature. When I'm struggling with a track, it's rarely because I lack technical knowledge – it's usually because I'm trying to force the music to be something it doesn't want to be.

This approach transforms the creative process from a battle into a dance. You stop trying to dominate sound and start partnering with it. The question shifts from "what should I make?" to "what's trying to emerge here?" – and that subtle shift changes everything.

And how do we collaborate with this musical energy? Through the art of selection.

Production becomes a conversation where music suggests possibilities, and I respond by selecting finite choices from literally infinite options. Every track I've ever released represents a series of decisive selections made in dialogue with the music itself: this sound resonates with what's emerging, not that one; this rhythm honors the energy, not those; this progression serves the story wanting to be told.

I approach production like curating a museum – not every beautiful piece belongs in the same exhibition. The magic doesn't come from collecting every possible sound but from selecting the precise elements that create a coherent emotional experience. This requires developing the sensitivity to hear what the music is asking for, and the courage to say no to perfectly good options that simply don't serve its direction.

The most common mistake I see producers make isn't technical – it's the failure to commit to choices in response to what's emerging. They keep every option open, every parameter automatable, every decision reversible. But great music emerges from commitment to the conversation, from saying: "I hear you, and this is how I'm responding." Selection is where your unique voice in this collaboration lives.

The technical aspects of production are tools, not goals. I'm far more interested in creating emotional resonance than technical perfection. A technically flawless track that evokes nothing is a failure; a technically imperfect track that moves people to tears is a masterpiece.

I approach every sound design choice, mixing decision, and arrangement element with a single question: "What emotion is this serving?" Rather than asking if something is technically correct, I ask if it's emotionally truthful. This seemingly subtle shift completely transforms the production process.

The irony is that when you prioritize emotional authenticity, technical excellence often follows naturally – but with purpose rather than perfectionism. You make technical decisions in service of feeling, not arbitrary standards. This is how you develop a sound that's distinctively yours instead of one that's interchangeably "professional."

## The Producer You Could Be

Imagine approaching your DAW without the weight of expectation or self-judgment. No more anxiety about whether your music will measure up to some arbitrary standard. No more paralysis trying to perfectly recreate sounds from your reference tracks. Instead, you move through the creative process with curiosity and playfulness, embracing the unexpected turns as part of the conversation.

This shift creates a profound creative freedom. The endless overthinking that paralyzes so many producers – "Is this kick drum right?" "Does this arrangement follow the correct structure?" "Will other producers approve of this mix?" – gives way to more meaningful questions about emotional impact and authentic expression.

What would it feel like to finish tracks regularly not through discipline or willpower, but because you're so engaged in the conversation with the music that completion becomes a natural conclusion? What would change if you approached production with the same playful curiosity you had when you first discovered it, but now enhanced by technical knowledge that serves your expression rather than constrains it? This is the liberation available when you fundamentally reorient your relationship with the creative process.

Beneath the technical questions about which plugin to use or how to structure your track lies a more fundamental artistic question: What are you actually trying to express? When you clear away the technical noise and industry expectations, what sounds, emotions, and experiences are uniquely yours to share?

The most valuable asset you possess as a producer isn't your technical knowledge or plugin collection – it's your unique perspective. No one else has lived your exact life, felt your specific emotions, or experienced sound through your particular sensory system. The producer you could be has learned to transform these singular experiences into music that could only have come from you.

This authentic expression isn't about abandoning technical excellence – it's about directing that excellence toward communicating something genuine. When you create from this place, technical decisions become clearer because they're in service of your specific expression. You're no longer lost in endless options because you have a clear artistic direction guiding your choices.

Perhaps the most valuable transformation isn't just in the music you create but in your relationship with creativity itself. The producer you could be has developed a sustainable creative practice that doesn't depend on sporadic inspiration or endless technical acquisition. You've built a reliable approach to music creation that continues to evolve without burning you out.

This sustainability comes from aligning your production process with deeper principles rather than fleeting trends or techniques. When your approach is built on the foundation of emotional authenticity and collaborative listening, it remains relevant regardless of how production technology evolves or music styles change. You're no longer chasing the next plugin or technique but deepening your relationship with music itself.

The result is creative longevity. Rather than burning brightly for a short period before succumbing to burnout or disillusionment – the fate of so many technically skilled but philosophically adrift producers – you develop a practice that continues to nourish both you and your listeners over the long term. Your relationship with music becomes regenerative rather than extractive.

## The Methodology

Traditional production education treats learning as accumulation – the more techniques and information you gather, the better producer you'll become. My methodology inverts this approach. Instead of adding more, we begin by simplifying – stripping away unnecessary complexity to reconnect with the fundamental purpose of each production decision.

This simplification creates space for the most important aspect of my teaching approach: experiential learning. Rather than telling you what to think about production, I guide you through experiences that allow you to discover essential principles through direct engagement. These aren't abstract exercises but practical explorations with immediate application to your music.

The structure provides progressive challenges designed to develop both technical skill and artistic clarity. Each experience builds upon previous ones, creating a cumulative transformation in how you approach both the creative and technical aspects of production. The result isn't just greater knowledge but a fundamentally different relationship with the entire production process.

A core principle of my methodology is the paradoxical relationship between constraints and creativity. I've found that unlimited freedom often creates paralysis, while thoughtful constraints can catalyze creative breakthroughs. My approach creates intentional boundaries that focus your attention on the decisions that matter most for developing your authentic expression.

This balance manifests through structured exploration. Each module provides clear frameworks that simplify decision-making without prescribing outcomes. For example, rather than overwhelming you with infinite sound design possibilities, I might direct you to create emotional texture using only three sound sources – a constraint that forces creative problem-solving and intentional choice-making.

These boundaries aren't arbitrary restrictions but carefully designed spaces for creative discovery. Like a playground with sturdy fences that allow children to play freely without constant vigilance, these frameworks provide the security to experiment boldly without getting lost in endless options. The result is paradoxical: greater creative freedom through thoughtful limitation.

This course doesn't ignore technical skills – it transforms how you approach them. Rather than teaching techniques as ends in themselves, I present them as tools for emotional expression. Every technical concept is introduced with a clear purpose: how does this serve the feeling you're trying to create?

This philosophical reframing turns production decisions from technical problems into emotional choices. EQ isn't just about frequency management but about emotional clarity – which elements deserve focus in this emotional narrative? Compression isn't simply dynamic control but emotional intensity – what feeling are you trying to enhance? Arrangement isn't just structural organization but emotional journey – what experience are you creating for the listener?

This approach develops technical skills that are both more sophisticated and more purposeful. You'll learn to make decisions based on emotional impact rather than technical correctness, developing an intuitive understanding of how technical choices translate to listener experience. The result is music that's not just technically competent but emotionally compelling.

## Evidence of Transformation

The true measure of this approach isn't in how it sounds in theory, but in how it transforms real producers' relationships with music and creativity. These aren't testimonials about technical tricks learned or career advancement (though those often follow). They reflect profound shifts in how these artists experience the creative process itself—the kind of changes that sustain artistic growth long after any course ends.

"TÂCHES taught me how to trust myself as a musician. Because of him, I now feel an incredible sense of freedom and creativity where before there was darkness. He is an amazing producer and a one of a kind teacher so if you get the chance to work with him... take it."

— Fur Skillman (ELI & FUR)

"For me, working with TÂCHES feels like sitting with a fountain of infinite creativity, inspiration and momentum. His passion for music shines through as a conduit for feeling and an invitation for movement… I don't just leave his presence inspired to make music, I find myself more interested in the tender intricacies of the human experience, knowing everything I feel will become an ingredient in a delicious sonic soup."

— Michelle Tomlinson (PIANIKA)

"I discovered a deeper and more spiritual connection to music. He doesn't simply teach you how to make it – he introduces you to its very essence. TÂCHES showed me that it's about allowing the melodies and harmonies to flow through you naturally."

— Igor Volhonski (HELLOVE)

"Working with TÂCHES helped me reconnect with what matters after eight years of producing. His techniques are centered around delivering freedom - freedom from perfectionism and self-criticism. He shows you how to make music that genuinely comes from within. The breakthroughs have been amazing on every level."

— Ron Obadia (Kabumi)

"Despite producing for 7+ years, I learned so much from TÂCHES. He encourages authentic, courageous growth and his thought-provoking discoveries and optimistic attitude are contagious. I'm proud to be his student and grateful for the depth added to my music."

— Jovanni Jimenez (JOVI)

"This gave me real clarity around how to approach drums, mixing and mastering and starting new projects without overthinking every small decision. TÂCHES is hilarious and his ability to relate to his students with funny anecdotes made each lesson a joy. Before this, I found excuses not to make music because 'I wasn't inspired.' Now, I feel empowered to create inspiration for myself."

— Samuel Rich (Sam Rich)

"What a brilliant experience! It really helped me have less judgement around my music and taught me to unify myself more with the process. I really harmonise with TÂCHES' unique way of connecting with music in an organic, ritualistic kind of way. Being part of a community together and learning as a community is just amazing. It really helped me level up and I'm much more able to enjoy making music and have become much less afraid to share it with others."

— Dylan Brooks

The transformation these producers describe isn't about acquiring more techniques—it's about fundamentally changing their relationship with creativity itself. They've moved from struggle to flow, from overthinking to intuition, from isolation to connection. This represents the core promise of this approach: not just better music, but a more meaningful, sustainable relationship with the creative process.

## Final Philosophical Note

The perspective I've shared throughout this page extends beyond individual production practice to a broader understanding of music itself. When we view music as a mysterious energy we collaborate with rather than control, we become part of something larger than our individual creative efforts.

This view connects us to a lineage of music-makers across time and culture who understood sound as a bridge between worlds – concrete and abstract, visible and invisible, known and unknown. Your role in this lineage isn't to perfect technical execution but to develop your unique contribution to this ongoing conversation.

Whether you choose to explore these ideas through this course or through your own path, I encourage you to consider what would change if you approached music not as something you make but as something you help emerge. What might shift if you viewed each production decision not as imposing your will on sound but as responding to what the music itself is asking to become? This perspective doesn't diminish your importance as an artist; it elevates your role from technician to collaborator with something profound and enduring.
